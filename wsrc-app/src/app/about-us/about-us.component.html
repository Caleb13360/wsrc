        <h2 class="text-cWhite text-xl md:text-2xl mb-4 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter">
            Yes, there is an entry fee to register for a race. This fee helps build the prize pool for the competition, giving
            racers the
            opportunity to win cash rewards. The remaining funds go towards maintaining and improving WSRC, including running
            the race servers, hosting and commentating live streams, and ensuring the overall quality of the
            experience for all participants.

        <h1 class="text-cWhite  text-3xl md:text-5xl mb-6 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter font-bold pt-10 ">Does the Prize Pool change depending on how many race participants there are?</h1>
        <h2 class="text-cWhite text-xl md:text-2xl mb-4 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter">
        Yes, the prize pool scales based on the number of race participants. For example, if 20 racers register for a race with
        a
        $100 entry fee, the prize pool will be $1,000. However, if only 18 racers register, the prize pool will adjust
        accordingly to be
        $900. This dynamic scaling ensures fairness and transparency while reflecting the contributions from participants.

        <h1 class="text-cWhite  text-3xl md:text-5xl mb-6 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter font-bold pt-10 ">What happens if I register for a race but end up missing the race?</h1>
        <h2 class="text-cWhite text-xl md:text-2xl  mb-4 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter">
        If you register for a race but don’t participate, your entry fee will be forfeited. This is because your spot in the
        race could have
        been taken by another participant, and the entry fee helps maintain the prize pool and support WSRC operations. Make
        sure
        to only register for races you’re confident you can attend!

        <h2 class="text-cWhite text-xl md:text-2xl mb-4 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter">
        The only requirement is you must have an active iRacing subscription and already own the car and track combination being
        used
        for the event. Beyond that, registration is on a first-come, first-served basis—so make sure to secure your spot quickly
        before
        the race fills up!

        <h2 class="text-cWhite text-xl md:text-2xl mb-4 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter">
        Yes, you can withdraw your entry fee up to 24 hours before the race. However, once the 24-hour mark has passed, entry
        fees are
        non-refundable. Please make sure you’re committed to participating before registering for a race.

        <h2 class="text-cWhite text-xl md:text-2xl mb-4 font-roboto-condensed tracking-tighter pb-10">

        fair
        competition and a great experience for everyone. Breaking rules may lead to penalties or disqualification.
